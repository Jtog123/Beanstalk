# Beanstalk

“Fee-fi-fo-fum,\
I smell the blood of an Englishman.\
Be he alive, or be he dead,\
I’ll grind his bones to make my bread.”


Beanstalk in a general purpose programming language. The creation of this language serves as an excerise in trying to understand the nuts and bolts of programming language design and creation.

The inspiration for the name comes from the old English fairy tale "Jack and the Beanstalk".
