# Beanstalk

“Fee-fi-fo-fum,\
I smell the blood of an Englishman.\
Be he alive, or be he dead,\
I’ll grind his bones to make my bread.”


Beanstalk in a general purpose programming language. The creation of this language serves as an excerise in trying to understand the nuts and bolts of programming language design and creation.

The inspiration for the name comes from the old English fairy tale "Jack and the Beanstalk".

The language will look like most other C style languages with a few key differences implemented for pure differentiation.

OOP (Object Oriented Programming) languages come with a few key language features which Beanstalk will also implement. These features are Classes, functions, for loops, and if statements.
Typically in most languages they would be defined something like this:

class Object;\
int functionName {};\
for(int i = 0; i < conditionall; i++);\
if(conditional);

Beanstalk will maintain the functionality of these language features and only adjust the syntax

Fee = Class\Object
fi = if statements\
fo = for loops\
fum = functions
